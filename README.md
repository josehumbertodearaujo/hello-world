# hello-world

Hi Humans.
My name is José Humberto. I'm bachelor in statistics by Federal University of Goiás. Currently I work in Centrocouros Inhumas as a office assistent, but now, I'm getting started in the world of programing. I'm very exited with this new step of my life and hope things goes well.

Thanks for read this.
